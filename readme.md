This program is designed to completely automate the process of two-loop self energy calculation taking an input of a FeynArts model file all the way through to a numerical result for the self energy.

We make use of the following tools to complete this process:

- **FeynArts:** (hep-ph/0012260) is used to generate the two-loop amplitudes
- **FeynCalc:**  (ArXiv:1601.01167) is used to reduce the amplitudes
- **TARCER:**  (hep-ph/9801383) is used to reduce the resulting amplitudes to basis integrals
- **TSIL:**  (hep-ph/0501132) is used to evaluate the basis integrals

\subsection generation Generating a spectrum generator

Before you setup a FlexibleSUSY model, you have to provide a SARAH
model file.  To make it available in FlexibleSUSY, you can put it
either into FlexibleSUSY's SARAH model directory
`FlexibleSUSY/sarah/<model>/` or directly into SARAH's own model
directly `SARAH/Models/<model>/`.

Here `<model>` is the name of your model (e.g. MSSM, NMSSM, etc.).
Note, that there are already plenty of pre-installed model files under
`SARAH/Models/` that can be used.

Setup a FlexibleSUSY model

    ./createmodel --name=<model>

See `./createmodel --help` for more details.  Afterwards there will be

- a model directory <code>models/\<model\>/</code>
- a makefile module <code>models/\<model\>/module.mk</code>
- a Mathematica start script <code>models/\<model\>/start.m</code>
- and a FlexibleSUSY model file <code>models/\<model\>/FlexibleSUSY.m</code>

To modify the model details (input parameters, boundary conditions,
etc.), please edit the FlexibleSUSY model file
`models/<model>/FlexibleSUSY.m`.  The model file options are explained
in more detail in @ref model_file_options .

Create the Makefile and register your model

    ./configure --with-models=<model>

Use `./configure --with-models=all` to build all available models.
See `./configure --help` for more options.

Start the spectrum generator generation and compile it by running

    make

When `make` is executed, Mathematica is called and generates the C++
code for the spectrum generator.  All C++ source files are written to
`models/<model>/`.  Afterwards this C++ code will be compiled and a
user example spectrum generator `models/<model>/run_<model>.x` will be
created.

### Example ###

     ./createmodel --name=NMSSM
     ./configure --with-models=NMSSM
     make

\section running_the_sg Running the spectrum generator

\subsection running_the_sg_cmd_line Running the spectrum generator from the command line

To run the spectrum generator at the command line, execute

    ./models/<model>/run_<model>.x --slha-input-file=<slha-input-file>

where `<slha-input-file>` is an SLHA input file.  For more details on
the SLHA input options see @ref slha_input_fields .

### Example ###

    ./models/NMSSM/run_NMSSM.x --slha-input-file=model_files/NMSSM/LesHouches.in.NMSSM

The SLHA input can also read from `stdin` by using the dash `-` as
input file name:

    cat model_files/NMSSM/LesHouches.in.NMSSM | ./models/NMSSM/run_NMSSM.x --slha-input-file=-

To specify a file name for the SLHA output use the
`--slha-output-file=` option.

### Example ###

    ./models/NMSSM/run_NMSSM.x --slha-input-file=model_files/NMSSM/LesHouches.in.NMSSM --slha-output-file=LesHouches.out.NMSSM

To suppress the SLHA output leave the file name after
`--slha-output-file=` empty.

The output can also be written to an SQLite database using the
`--database-output-file=` option.

### Example ###

    ./models/NMSSM/run_NMSSM.x --slha-input-file=model_files/NMSSM/LesHouches.in.NMSSM --slha-output-file= --database-output-file=point.db

\subsection running_the_sg_mathematica Running the spectrum generator from inside Mathematica

Since version 1.7.0, FlexibleSUSY provides a Mathematica interface.
Please see \ref librarylink for more details and examples.

\section no_compilation Creating only the source code files -- no compilation

If you want to only create the C++ source files for your model, but do
not want to compile the code, you can use the `--disable-compile`
configure option:

    ./configure --with-models=MSSM --disable-compile
    make

Here, `configure` will not check for installed compilers or libraries.
It will only check for Mathematica and SARAH.  The execution of `make`
will stop as soon as all C++ source code files are generated.


\section only_compilation Compile only -- no code generation

If you want to only compile already created the C++ source files for
your model, you can use the `--disable-meta` configure option:

    ./configure --with-models=MSSM --disable-meta
    make

Here, `configure` will only check for installed compilers or
libraries.  It will not check for Mathematica and SARAH.

Warning: Please make sure all C++ source files of your model are
available in the model directory `models/<model>/`.  Otherwise the
compilation will fail.


\section export_src Exporting the generated source code

The generated C++ source code can be exported to a separate directory,
without the Mathematica meta code.  This exported directory will be a
complete standalone package, with it's own build system.  To export
the code, one has to set the target directory during configuration via
the `--with-install-dir=` option.  For example

    ./configure --with-models=<models> --with-install-dir=/path/to/export/directory

By running

    make install-src

the generated C++ source code for all `<models>` is copied to
`/path/to/export/directory`, together with the non-model specific
source code from `config/`, `doc/`, `legacy/`, `slhaea/` and `src/`.
Afterwards, the standalone package can be build via

    cd /path/to/export/directory
    ./configure --with-models=all
    make

It is also possible to create a package which includes only the
generated source code of a given model.  To create such a package run

    make pack-<model>-src

where `<model>` is the name of the model whose generated source code
shall be packed.  After `make` has finished, the package file
`<model>.tar.gz` can be found in the working directory.


\section dynamic_libraries Dynamic libraries

If you want to create dynamic libraries (instead of static libraries)
you have to pass all the following options to the `configure` script

    --enable-shared-libs
    --with-shared-lib-ext=".so"
    --with-shared-lib-cmd="gcc -shared -o"

When using Intel compilers, replace `gcc` by `icc` or `icpc`.

Example:

    ./configure --with-models=MSSM,NMSSM --enable-shared-libs --with-shared-lib-ext=".so" --with-shared-lib-cmd="gcc -shared -o"

Important remark:

The libraries are linked to the executables with _absolute_ paths.
This means that, if you move the package directory to another
location, the executables will no longer run, because the libraries
are now at another place.  To make the executables work again, you
have to rebuild them via

    make clean-executables
    make allexec


\section static_linking Statically linked executables

External libraries can be statically linked to the spectrum generator
executables by setting linker specific flags in `LDFLAGS`.  On some
systems additional libraries have to be linked to the executables in
such cases.  In FlexibleSUSY such additional libraries can be
specified in the variable `LDLIBS`.

Example (using `g++` on Debian Jessie):

    ./configure --with-models=CMSSM --with-ldflags="-static" --with-ldlibs="-lquadmath -ldl"

This will create a standalone executable which does not depend on
dynamic libraries.


\section cleaning Cleaning up

There are several make targets to remove generated files, compiled
object files, libraries or executables:

     make clean      # deletes all .d .o .a .x files

     make distclean  # does `clean' and `clean-generated'
                     # and deletes in addition:
                     # Makefile flexiblesusy-config config.*
                     # config/list_sarah_model_files.sh

     make clean-dep  # deletes all .d files

     make clean-executables # deletes all .x files

     make clean-generated   # deletes generated files

     make clean-lib  # deletes all libraries

     make clean-obj  # deletes all .o files

For each model `<model>` or addon there are specific clean targets to
remove model-specific files:

     make clean-<model>     # deletes .d .o .a .x and generated files

     make distclean-<model> # same as `make clean-<model> clean-<model>-src'

     make clean-<model>-dep # deletes .d files

     make clean-<model>-lib # deletes model library

     make clean-<model>-obj # deletes .o files

     make clean-<model>-src # deletes generated files


\section looptools Looptools

It is possible to use Looptools (http://www.feynarts.de/looptools/)
for calculating the loop functions, instead of using Softsusy's loop
functions.  To enable Looptools configure via

    ./configure --enable-looptools

To use the Looptools library and header files from a specific
directory configure via

    ./configure --enable-looptools --with-looptools-incdir="/path/to/looptools/build/" --with-looptools-libdir="/path/to/looptools/build/"

Note: Looptools 2.8 or higher is required.  Versions <= 2.7 will fail
to build with the following compiler error message (or similar):

    In file included from models/MSSM/MSSM_two_scale_model.cpp:28:0:
    /usr/include/clooptools.h:67:28: error: conflicting declaration ‘typedef struct std::complex<double> Complex’
    In file included from src/utils.h:15:0,
                     from src/rge.h:17,

                     from models/MSSM/MSSM_two_scale_model.hpp:25,
                     from models/MSSM/MSSM_two_scale_model.cpp:21:

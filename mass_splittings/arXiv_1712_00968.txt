To produce figures in 1712.00968:

Install contents of output directories into models/MDM/output and models/MSSM/output

Open mass_splittings/splittings.cpp and uncomment the stuff under "Figures for second paper" that is relevant for MDM

./mass_buidler -g -m MDM -i models/MDM/lists/Full.txt
cd build
cmake .
make splittings -j4
cd ..
./splittings -i models/MDM/input.txt
python mass_splittings/plotting_scripts/plot_MDM_2loop.py



Open mass_splittings/splittings.cpp and uncomment the stuff under "Figures for second paper" that is relevant for EW_triplet (MSSM)

./scripts/clean.sh
./mass_buidler -g -m MSSM -i models/MSSM/lists/Full.txt
cd build
cmake .
make splittings -j4
cd ..
./splittings -i models/MSSM/input.txt
python mass_splittings/plotting_scripts/plot_MSSM_2loop.py

Figures 4 and 10 are a bit of a hassle to make and I will not explain them here right now.
